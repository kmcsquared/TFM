# Analysis and Predictions of the Evolution of Modern Basketball
The goal of this project is to analyse the evolution of the game of basketball in the last 20 years and to predict how the sport will be played in the future. These tasks are performed using data science and machine learning tools with official data from the National Basketball Association (NBA). The data selected show the shooting statistics and the physical characteristics of the players from the 2000-01 season up to the 2020-21 season. Throughout this 20-year span there have been notable shifts in the style of play and in the NBA player prototype. These changes include the speed at which the game is played, the shot selection and efficiency, the players' physical characteristics and their positions. The experiments I present aim to prove these tendencies (and some more) to gain insight into today's basketball and to provide a forecast on how it will continue to evolve.
